<p>cd ..is used to come out of directory and mkdir filename-is used to makea new file or repo, mkdir do not use file name with spaces
    use - cd filename
    Now we have created a local repo
    But this repo is not a Github repo we can cheque it using ls -a <command>
        To make it a Github repo we use git in it
        Now we can add and commit changes in the local repo
        After this if we want to push this court to get up we have to create a repository there and do not create a rate me file in the Github
