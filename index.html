<p>cd ..is used to come out of directory and mkdir filename-is used to makea new file or repo, mkdir do not use file name with spaces
    use - cd filename
    Now we have created a local repo
    But this repo is not a Github repo we can cheque it using ls -a <command>
        To make it a Github repo we use git in it
        Now we can add and commit changes in the local repo
        After this if we want to push this court to get up we have to create a repository there and do not create a rate me file in the Github
        Now we will copy the link of that repository and use -git remote add origin <link>
        we can check it using git remote -v
        then use -git brach - to fing in which brach are you in
        then use - git brach -m main  - to name this brach as main
        now we can push it by using -  git push origin main    or 
        we can use -git push -u origin main   ,It will help us if we want to push again it will push in the same repository and we will only have to use command  -git push
